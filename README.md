# RelativeTranslationGains

Hi! 

I'm a Ph.D student in KAIST and my major is AR/VR.
I'm interested in mutual space generation for extended reality (XR) remote collaboration.

We propose concept of 'relative translation gains' and estimate a threshold range of it according to mutual space configuration.
